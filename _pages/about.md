My name is Yuzong Chen, a PhD student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I am advised by [Prof. Mohamed Abdelfattah](https://www.mohsaied.com/) and affiliated with the [Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL)](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/). My current research focus on Efficient Hardware Architectures for Sparse and Mixed-Precision Deep Learning Acceleration. 

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. After graduation, I spent 3 years as a research staff at the Nanyang Technological University (advised by [Prof. Tony Tae-Hyoung Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/tonykim)) and the National University of Singapore (advised by [Prof. Heng Chun-Huat](https://online.ece.nus.edu.sg/staff/web.asp?id=elehch)). 

I am a finalist of the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (QiF), 2024.
